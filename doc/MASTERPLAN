Milestone 1:
* Load data and do generic print to stdout

Milestone 2:
* Create function to drop one column: "location"
* Create data -> drop column -> stdout pipeline

Milestone 3:
* Create function to merge two columns: "fname" "lname" -> "fullname"
* Extend drop column function to be able to drop multiple columns (ie. take list of column names)
* Create data -> merge("fname", "lname" -> "fullname") -> drop("fname", "lname") -> stdout

Milestone 4:
* Create csv reader
* Create csv reader -> any function -> stdout pipeline

Milestone X:
* manipulation of data in a column (eg. ALL CAPS, search/replace)
* column renaming
* write to csv
* read from a database
* write to DB
* filter function (ie. two outputs)
* merge function (ie. two inputs -> one output) - doesn't have to be join - could just be append one table to the other - which should probably require the same columns
